#### 4.) CONCLUSION:
There is a likely chance that after a decent number of customers looked through the product-related page, they decided to navigate away from the website. Then they opened a new website in the same session to finish the purchase. The above speculation is why many successful revenue records happen when the session has a short duration and high bounce rate.

In conclusion, based on what we just found, I suggest that the website reformat and add more useful links like recommended similar products, quick checkout button, etc. For the sake of improving their bounce rates, convenient their customers, and even make more profits and revenues.
